## Completed Tasks
- [x] Implement weekly image refresh: Added weekly cache refreshing of destination images every Sunday to improve loading reliability and reduce API calls. Modified travelApi.js to add cache metadata and destination.jsx to display refresh information.
- [x] Implement attraction image preloading: Added real-time image preloading for attractions that refresh on the same weekly cycle as destination images. Modified travelApi.js to add a new API function and updated destination.jsx to display and refresh attraction images.

## Notes
- Image caching system now has a weekly refresh cycle that clears the cache every Sunday
- The destination page shows when the next image refresh will happen
- Attraction images now use the same caching system and refresh cycle as destination images
- Users can manually refresh attraction images with a dedicated refresh button
- Files modified: src/services/travelApi.js and src/pages/destination/destination.jsx
